First Fight is a ten-second battle orchestrated by Satoru Gojo used to test Yuji's control over one of Sukuna's fingers.


### Megumi summoning the Divine General Mahoraga

Well, the Zenin Family has been very unfortunate that no Ten Shadows technique user has ever `tamed`this beast. But it is possible to defeat Mahoraga without any doubt. This unbelievable feat was achieved by Sukuna in the Shibuya incident arc.
