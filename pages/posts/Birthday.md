I don’t know why, but I keep getting hooked on one thing or another games, tablets, comics, anime, speeding bikes, code, talks, even cigs. And then, out of nowhere, I just lose interest. It’s happened to me more times than I can count.

There’s never a specific moment when it ends, but once the boredom hits, I rarely ever go back to those things.

  

Last week, I celebrated my birthday .it was cute and cool. Got some beautiful gifts too. I’m truly thankful to God for whatever life brings my way.

  

I still have a few regrets to move on from, but it is what it is. Life can be unfair and beautiful at the same time. We often only appreciate the good things once they’re gone. I’m still on that journey, trying to make sense of it all.

  

Some forms of happiness come from within untouched by the outside world. And yeah, I almost forgot to mention I’ll be meeting my bestie after such a long time! Though honestly, I don’t even know what we’ll talk about. I’ve got zero conversation starters lined up.

  

This moment of introspection? Something I’ve learned from her.

‘walking. up the ladder of life...meeting people... learning and growing’. I love how it’s all described in such simple words, and I genuinely connect with every word she once said.

Anyways lets see what the next week unfolds for me.
