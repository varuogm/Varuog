Can we bring back that college-era “vibe coding”?

Can we get healthier and more mindful?

Can we explore new domains, new businesses? Finance mainly

Can we finally start understanding money? I know shit about taxes and finances ,lossing a hell lot of money to it

Can’t we cut down on social media?

Go to planned international trip this December

Can we Meet those Twitter mutuals.

Can we Plan for a better home. One cute flat 

Can we Start teaching on YouTube again. (No leetcode probs now) also no scaler this time 

Can we aim to fill the senior sde knowlege gap that lacks ,everything in between.

Can we stop being overly generous? Not everyone needs saving—and that’s not our job.

We’ve got fewer years left. Why not aim to be at the top?

I’ve seen the best, and I’ve fallen from it.

For a while, it felt like the end—

But now, I see it was just a pause.

It’s time to aim again—this time, for the bigger things in life.

Everything I set out to achieve in 2024 is now accomplished

I’m ready to take even bigger steps ahead.

Everything I did over the past decade felt easy .I haven’t even touched the hard stuff yet. Enough enjoyment and parties ,cant take every situation as my guilt .this year I’m focussing on power . 

Lets see
