 My cricketing journey started with yours, Virat. And might retire you as well.

Main kabhi cricket ka banda nahi tha, but you made me fall in love with the game. You made me stay. You made me feel things I didn’t think a sport ever could. Aaj jo mera fav hai , usme tera role hai. Tera junoon, tera attitude, tera “never back down” wala mindset 🥹sab kuch.


Honestly, there’s so much I want to say . I’m not feeling anything lol. it. I used to wonder how will I react? Will I cry? Will I stop watching cricket?

But aaj… I just feel numb. Khali sa lag raha hai. It’ll take time to sink in.

  
Your aggression wasn’t ever about ego it was about standing tall for your team.

That look in your eyes, the way you celebrated every run, every wicket
And that’s what made you special. You always stood for what was right ,chahe teammate ho, game ki dignity ho, ya kisi aur ki respect.

 
You carried pressure like it was weightless, and still lifted others around you.

That rare mix of intensity aur loyalty… yeh har kisi mein nahi hota. 

Off the field, you’re just as inspiring.
Down to earth, rooted, humble. Despite all the trophies, fame, and records you stayed real. That’s what makes you not just a great cricketer, but a great human being.

Thank you, Virat. Not just for the runs, but for the feeling.

For the goosebumps, the shouting-at-2AM moments, the “yes he’s still there, anything can happen” wali hope. You gave us a reason to watch.

people finally getting what they wanted.... a quieter test scene. Congrats now uou have a dull non energetic team ,doing the bare minimum to get themselves in the team no clear spark. I dont blame them but it was YOU who made the standard high . Topping all the charts and achivements gloablly .

AUS dont cover news or published apart from their team ,but even they cherish him as an opponent and dont kiss any updates on thier newspaper .


when team needed you the most ,you saved us from every grave situation. Thats what the world know about you. 
 
A few things, straight from the heart:

•  I’m not sad because you retired—I’m sad kyunki aisa lagta hai kuch bada hua hai. Kuch aisa jo cricket se bhi bada tha. Varna all of a sudden ,idk not posssible man

•  Retiring at your peak… bina 10k runs complete kiye… ye woh script nahi thi jo chhote Virat ne likhi thi. Ye woh ending nahi thi jo humne sochi thi, even last year tak.

•  ODI is still remaining.Aur we’ll be cheering, believing, celebrating. Maybe now more glittering eyes but with a slight tention of your possibilitily of random retiring from it as well.

Your achievements in cricket and beyond are incredible.

Bachpan se leke budhape tak everyone knows you, everyone respects you. Even aunties jo sirf TV serials dekhti thi, now know you. And love you.

someone in the gc said ‘never attach yourself to a sportsperson in your life, you really have better things to do in your life’ and now i can completely get it why. You chetish something and one day its lost because its not yours . Sad
  
Will I still watch cricket? Yes .


Maybe not like before. Shayad vo thrill wapas na aaye. But haanchhoti matches, moments, and that spark… main tune in karta rahunga. 
Last thing will miss seeing you in whites, my man.

But let’s win that 2027 World Cup now, 
For the memories, the madness, the meaning.
