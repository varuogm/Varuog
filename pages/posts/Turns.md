There was a math teacher in my college humble, knowledgeable, and always ready to help. He was one of the few teachers I genuinely admired, a true embodiment of what a teacher should be. He taught in colleges due to financial constraints, but he was exceptionally good at it. At that time, he was unmarried.

  

There wasn’t a problem he couldn’t solve. He always said, “Bring any problem from any book, and I’ll solve it in no time” and he actually did. Students used to go to him not just for college questions, but he would also explain all possible solutions and teach smart tricks to get approximate answers.

  

Once, I was stuck on a problem. Even though I hadn’t studied, he explained it so well that I grasped the concept instantly. I gently asked him, “If you’re so good, why don’t you try for a better college where you could earn more?” He shared that teaching was just his part-time job; his real goal was to pursue higher studies in mathematics and earn a PhD in his favorite subject.

  

He also said something I’ll never forget: in the coming years, only one of two things would happen. either he’d achieve what he dreamed of and reach the best place, or he’d give up everything, including math, marry someone, and live a normal life as if nothing ever happened.

  

He’s one of the few teachers I’m still connected with on Facebook. Two years ago, he gave it all up, got married, and now he posts reels like a foolish person. No one would ever guess the math genius he once was. No more research, no more research papers he lost all interest in what he once loved.

  

I used to wonder, is it really possible to forget something you love? Now, at this stage, I feel it all depends on the situation. A man’s life is tough. He must have gone through something only he knew.

  

Life takes strange turns.

  

I’m happy for where he is now, and I’m grateful I got to be taught by him for a part of my life.

Thank you, Amit Sir.
